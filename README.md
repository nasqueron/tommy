## Tommy

Tommy is a little Sinatra app that likes to keep an eye on Jenkins (or Hudson)
build statuses.

It divides the screen into cards, each representing a build status
and offering quick links.

See https://builds.nasqueron.org for a live example.

### Getting started

Put your Jenkins URL in place (HUDSON_URL) and boot the app.
If you are password protecting your Hudson dashboard then encode like this:
http://username:password@instance.domain.tld
