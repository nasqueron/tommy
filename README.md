## Tommy

Tommy is a little Sinatra app that likes to keep an eye on Jenkins (or Hudson)
build statuses.

It divides the screen into cards, each representing a build status
and offering quick links.

See https://builds.nasqueron.org for a live example.

### Getting started

The JENKINS_URL variable environment should point to your Jenkins instance.

If a login is required to use the API,
use https://login:password@jenkins.domain.tld as syntax.

### Run with Docker

A Docker image is also provided. It exposes a WEBrick server on the port 4567.

```
docker pull nasqueron/tommy
docker run -dt -p 8080:4567 -e JENKINS_URL=https://ci.domain.tld nasqueron/tommy
```

### Exit codes

The app uses the following exit codes:

*   0: regular exit
*   1: required configuration environment variable is missing
