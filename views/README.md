## Tommy

Tommy is a little Sinatra app that likes to keep an eye on Hudson (or Jenkins) build statuses. Why? Because the default Hudson UI is dull.

### Getting Started

Put your Hudson URL in place (HUDSON_URL) and boot the app. If you are password protecting your Hudson dashboard then encode like this: http://username:password@my.hudson.com
 
### TODO

  - Remove excessive dependencies
  - Write some tests
  - Actually test against Jenkins (have only tested )
